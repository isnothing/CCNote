Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, Linux and FreeBSD.\n\nNode.js provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API that optimizes an application\'s throughput and scalability. These technologies are commonly used for real-time applications.\n\nNode.js uses the Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute code, and a large percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript.

Today, the most widely known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure.',0),(69,'Scheme','Scheme is a functional programming language and one of the two main dialects of the programming language Lisp. Unlike Common Lisp, the other main dialect, Scheme follows a minimalist design philosophy specifying a small standard core with powerful tools for language extension.\n\nScheme was developed at the MIT AI Lab by Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman who introduced it to the academic world via a series of memos, now referred to as the Lambda Papers, over the period 1975â€“1980. It was the first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization, giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class continuations. It had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of Common Lisp.',0),(70,'LLVM','The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be used to build them. The name \"LLVM\" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.',0),(71,'Docker','Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.',0),(72,'C','In computing, C (/?si?/, as in the letter C) is a general-purpose programming language initially developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at AT&T Bell Labs.[5][6] Like most imperative languages in the ALGOL tradition, C has facilities for structured programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. Its design provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, most notably system software like the Unix computer operating system.[7]\n\nC is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time,[8][9] and C compilers are available for the majority of available computer architectures and operating systems.',0),(73,'Java','Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[10] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers \"write once, run anywhere\" (WORA),[11] meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another.[12] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java is, as of 2014, one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[13][14] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since merged into Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems\' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.',0);
